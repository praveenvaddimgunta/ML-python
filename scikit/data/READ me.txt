3D_spatial_network
---------------------
1. OSM_ID: OpenStreetMap ID for each road segment or edge in the graph. 
2. LONGITUDE: Web Mercaptor (Google format) longitude 
3. LATITUDE: Web Mercaptor (Google format) latitude 
4. ALTITUDE: Height in meters. 

Note: OSM_ID is the ID assigned by OpenStreetMaps ([Web Link]) to the road segments. Each (long,lat,altitude) point on a road segment (with unique OSM ID) is sorted in the same order as they appear on the road. So a 3D-polyline can be drawn by joining points of each row for each OSM_ID road segment.
